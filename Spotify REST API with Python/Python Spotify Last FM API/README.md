# Python-Spotify-Last-FM-API
A small project where you we get the top 20 trending songs from Last FM and create a Playlist in Spotify and add those songs into them.

Sign up for Last FM Api Key: https://www.last.fm/api/account/create

Read the documentation for other API methods: https://www.last.fm/api/intro

Head over to Spotify, get your userid and API Token.  (Make sure you select the correct scope else it will throw you an error)

Token URL: https://developer.spotify.com/console/post-playlists/

User ID : http://open.spotify.com/user/{userid}
or if you want to integrate it, you can: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/users-profile/get-current-users-profile/

I'd just recommend to hardcode it if you are new or a beginner.

Add the last fm API key, Spotify User Id and Spotify Token to secrets.py and then run base_file.py
